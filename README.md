# Student Marks Dataset
## Overview
This dataset contains information about student marks based on the number of courses taken and the time spent studying. 
It can be used to analyze the relationship between study time, number of courses, and academic performance.

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following columns:

1. number_courses: The number of courses the student is enrolled in.
2. time_study: The amount of time spent studying, measured in hours.
3. Marks: The marks obtained by the student, typically a percentage or score.

## Learning outcomes
This dataset can be used for different types of analyses:

### Supervised Learning:
Predicting Marks based on features such as number_courses and time_study.
Identifying how changes in number_courses and time_study affect Marks.
### Unsupervised Learning:
Clustering students based on number_courses and time_study to identify patterns or groups with similar study habits and performance.
Analyzing relationships between time_study, number_courses, and Marks to find correlations or trends.
